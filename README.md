### 2% Agarose Gel

Measure 3g of agarose
- Mix agarose powder with 150mL 1xTAE in a microwavable flask
- Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved (but do not overboil the solution, as some of the buffer will evaporate and thus alter the final percentage of agarose in the gel.
- Add ethidium bromide (EtBr) to a final concentration of approximately 0.3-0.6 μg/mL (usually about 2-3 μl of lab stock solution per 100 mL gel) or 1Oμl GreenGlow per 100mL TAE Agorose mix.

### Zebrafish Primer Prep Guide

- Go to: https://zfin.org/
- Search for sa number of the gene
- Copy last 40 bases of the mutated sequence
- Go to: https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat
- Select Zebrafish genome and latest assebmly for the organism
- Paste the copied sequence part and submit
- Click on the browser of the targetted chromosome
- Zoom in to the mutation site at the end
- View in DNA form, add 500 bases extra to both up and downstreams, all upper case and mask repeats to N. Get DNA, and copy the DNA seq.
- Go to: https://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi
- Change the task to Primer_List, primer size (18,19,21), primer tm (57,58,60), number to return (20) and gc clamp (2)
- Paste and submit the copied sequence
- Select the left and right primers
